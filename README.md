# Chowdown - Game Jam Fall 2017

In an alternate universe, planets are sentient and chocolaty creatures with a burning desire 
to destroy planets not of their own color. The game takes place in the Meatball System, a 
dangerous system full of meatball fields. Countless crusades and meatball collision incidents 
destroyed most of the planets in the Meatball System, and now only two opposing planets remain. 
Meatballs are toxic to our chocolaty friends, but are full of energy which can be converted to 
create more chocolate as deadly projectiles. The two planets have constructed energy fields capable
of shielding themselves from enemy chocolate, while also able to absorb meatballs to fuel their own
arsenal. While the fields cannot be made large enough to surround themselves, the planets are able 
to control their orbit as needed. Who will be the last planet standing in the Meatball System?!
